**These** are the things I consider important as a programmer. These are the principles I wanna live
by as I do my job.

In no particular order:

- I will test my code.
- I will be honest.
- I will keep learning.
- I will fight discrimination actively.
- I will share my knowledge.
- I will be open-minded.
- I will be coherent.


This is an eternal work in progress, and this list may evolve at any moment.

If you'd like, you can fork this repo and add your own mantras, or tweet me a tweet
